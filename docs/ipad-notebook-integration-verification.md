# iPad notebook integration — #4

Integration branch: `integration/handwriting-45`.
Task graph: #45 (complete) → #46 → #47 → #48.
Broader #4 and #44 have scope beyond this integration.

## Approved baseline

- #45 source: `329677bdcbfd218a0013d745ff21e273d628f567`.
- #45 owner acceptance: `8148bb93fc71c4621b0bcbb5b32629ba7ea97040`.
- Both commits passed local integration ancestry checks on this branch.
- Prior evidence: [#45 delivery](handwriting-notebook-delivery.md) and
  `/tmp/opencode/issue45-https-verification.json`.

## #46 implementation approval

The owner approved the concrete #46 implementation plan in this session after
reviewing its behavior, history/recovery boundaries, native IndexedDB and
25 MiB each image/source limits. Plan source at approval:
`/tmp/opencode/issue4-submission-plan-proposal.md` (final 290-line proposal).
Promote that approved content to `docs/handwriting-submission-plan.md` with the
implementation. Owner decisions are also retained at
`/home/bjorn/.cache/opencode/issue4/owner-decisions.md`.

Selected contracts include same-page unsent snapshot replacement, immutable sent
versions, persistent Undo/Redo, exact capture retries, explanation durability at
Attach, ordinary editing after definite rejection and acceptance reconciliation
for uncertain delivery. Unified Open/undoable Restore/explicit Duplicate are
carried into #47; its concrete implementation plan still needs approval.

## Verification and delivery

#46 implementation/checks have not yet run. Record exact delivery commits,
commands/results, reviews and integration ancestry here as they become available.
Use deterministic provider/speech fixtures and isolated data for automated checks.
Live-provider spending and preview-slot replacement need separate coordination.

Physical iPad acceptance remains distinct from browser emulation. Keep required
device gates open until owner confirmation. No push or remote merge is claimed.
